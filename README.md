# About

The purpose of this Ruby on Rails site is to rank players (called employees since I made it for an office) in a sport (currently pingpong). It generates an artificial ranking starting at 500 on the scale of 1 to 1000 and graphs their progress over time, as well as lists them. Players can set their own colors and names. Although you can run it as a normal rails app I believe the best way to deploy it is on Amazon EC2 and route it to your own domain name. The guide I found for EC2 was here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFBbcleSPoY
